# Quiz_Game
This repository contains various python files for the implementation of a text based quiz game. It consists of three classes: `Question`, `QuizBrain`, and the main program. The `Question` class is a blueprint for creating question objects, each containing the question text and its correct answer. The `QuizBrain` class manages the quiz, keeping track of the question number, the player's score, and providing methods to check answers and display questions. The main program initializes a set of questions using external data (`question_data`), creates a quiz instance, and runs the quiz by repeatedly asking questions until all questions are answered. Finally, it displays the player's score at the end of the quiz. The quiz covers various topics with true/false questions.
